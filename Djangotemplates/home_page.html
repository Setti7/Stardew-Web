          <p>Welcome to the SVFB project, where people like me (who can't fish for shit on this game) can now have a
               chance at it!<br>The project is still not complete, I now need help collecting data from the game to finish
               the machine learning process. Read below how to help!</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://github.com/Setti7/SVFB-GUI/releases" role="button">Download! &raquo;</a></p>

            <h2>How to help (please do)</h2>
            <p>If you can, download the program on the download button above, click <strong>start</strong> and play the game as normal!
                For it to work you need to use any keyboard button to fish (you just need to set it, the default is C). The program does <i>NOT</i> work if you
                fish with left-clicks.</p>
            <p><a class="btn btn-secondary" href="#" role="button">Read more on reddit &raquo;</a></p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                As soon as you click on start, the program will look on your screen for the fishing region, then, when the fishing
                mini-game starts, the program will record the fish's position on the screen, saving it together with you
                "C" clicks (or the any other keyboard button you use).<br> It stops recording as soon as the mini-game closes, and should automaticly send the data to
                this website.
            </p>

            <h2>I don't want to create an account!</h2>
            <p>I'm sorry, but if you want to help, you will need one to submit data (use the username from your porn
                account on reddit, I don't care). It is this way so there is no overwriting on my webserver.</p>
